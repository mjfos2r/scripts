# Some useful scripts

this is a very incomplete collection of the vast array of scripts I've written. These are just the most useful scripts that I've written in recent times.
vm.sh is incredibly powerful, alias it to `vm` if you really wanna get efficient. 

Use at your own risk. I'll add more of my scripts to this public repo whenever I feel like it.
